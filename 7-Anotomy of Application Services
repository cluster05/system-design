APPLICATION / SERVICES

What is Application/Services
    Application or services perform  certain responsibilities
    Application at different layers have different responsibilities
    Application at client side have different responsibilities, same as from server

    Application at client side and server side interact with each other,
    also if there are many application server side they are also interact
    with each other to full full curtain feature

    client   <---------   server
             ---------->

Tech Stack & Responsibilities
    Application is peace of code that mean it must be written in some language
    using certain framework

    Frontend : Java/Kotlin, Swift, JS
    Backend  : Python, Java, Go
    Database : Query

    Framework
        Frameworks do most of bootstrapping and common task that are needed for application
        We can use framework to hardness its power start building feature on top of it.


Responsibilities
    Client Apps
        Render UI elements
        Handling Interaction
        Collect Data
        Communicate with Backend (APIs)
        Render Static Data

        Housing Business Logic
        Handle data modeling/transformation
        Interact with data store
        Interact with other services

Elements/factors of App Design/Developments
    Eg Building Parking App

    Requirement : Feature requirement, who is application for
    Layers      : Mobile app,Desktop app according to it to for tech stack
    Tech Stack
    Code Structure/Design Pattern
    Data Store interaction
    Performance/Cost
    Deployment
    Monitoring   : For large scale application, logging for error, crashing report for analysis
    Excellence/Reliable



Monolithic Application
    Single Application manages all functionalities

    Managing Notes + Handling Payment + User data and auth

Microservice Application

    Have multiple services have multiple application to full fill multiple responsibilities

    Different Serviecs
