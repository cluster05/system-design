DATA AND DATAFLOW

Data
    Information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing.
    Data is stayed at the core of system design

Data Format/Representation
    Understand the what the different type of format and what are different properties
    so that design the system such way that exchange of data in easy and secure way

    Business Layer    -> text,videos,images,notes
    Application Layer -> JSON/XML
    DataStore (DB's)  -> table,index,list,trees
    Network Layer     -> Packets
    Hardware Layer    -> 0s & 1s

Datastore's
    Databases  - Username, User's Phone number, City, Address
    Queues     - Request:Response
    Caches     - Send sms request, Send email request
    Indexes    - Most searched items, items searched in last 1 hours

Data Flow Methods
    Methods which through data flow
    Data will exchange between components
    Eg.
    APIs
    Message
    Events

Data Generation
    Users     -  Users data
    Internal  -  Data about data, Logs of application, system population on their ow
    Insights  -  User Behavioural Pattern

Factors
    Factor consider about data before design system
    Type of Data           - Data could be text,images,videos
    Volume                 - system which support TB of data is diff from system which is support GB of data
    Consumption/Retrieval  - Read and writes of data, Rate at which it accessing
    Security               - Security of data

System Example :
Authorization :
    Volume :   small DB
    Security : High

Streaming :
    Volume :   Big DB
    Retrieval : High

Transaction :
    Volume : High ( Journey is Important )
    Security : High
