TYPES OF DATABASES

Different type of database bases on property of data

Types:
    Relations  ( SQL )
        Factor
            Schema -> How your data is representation
                      Database for inter related complex data can be easily designed
                      Ensures garbage or null value is not populated into the DB
                      Ensures all other schema constraints are followed
            ACID   ->
                    A - Atomicity - Traction in database is either
                                    happen completely or not happen at all
                    C - Consistency -  At given point of time state of DB should consistent
                    I - Isolation   -  Two transaction do not know about each other
                                    Read/Write happening What ever happen will give result
                    D - Durability  - Mechanism that database ensures write and update are happening
                                    they logged properly and data store properly
       Cannot Support ->
                Schema is not fixed
                New Data is coming every day

   Non-Relations ( NoSQL )
       Based On
           Key-Value Stores -
               Only key value format

               Advantages :
               Caching Solution
               Fast
               Quick Access

           Column based DBs
             Contain fixed schema and columns but this DB does not support the ACID properties
             Used in Heavy writes ( Event Data :  Music App , IOT Data )

             Does not support heavy writes
                 Table support and build according to condition

           Document Based DBs
              Usually used when schema is not fixed
              Support heavy reads and writes
              No complex Query

              No schema so some value is null
              No ACID property so sometime data can be inconsistency

              Mapping :
              table -> collection
              row   -> documents

           Search DBs
              Data stored in search DB is not primary DB, data is updated on basis of search query

    File
    Network
